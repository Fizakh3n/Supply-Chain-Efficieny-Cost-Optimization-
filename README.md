# Supply Chain Optimization & Logistics Dashboard  

## Overview  
Efficient supply chain management is critical for reducing costs, improving product availability, and maintaining smooth logistics operations. This Power BI dashboard provides data-driven insights to optimize supply chain performance by analyzing key metrics such as stock turnover, supplier performance, and shipping efficiency.  

## Business Problem  
Companies often face challenges in:  
- Managing inventory levels effectively to prevent stockouts or overstocking.  
- Evaluating supplier performance to minimize delays and quality issues.  
- Controlling shipping costs while maintaining efficient delivery timelines.  
- Optimizing order fulfillment and logistics for better decision-making.  

This dashboard provides actionable insights by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.  

## Key Insights & Impact  
- **Improved Inventory Management** → Analyzed stock turnover rates to identify fast-moving and slow-moving products.  
- **Supplier Performance Evaluation** → Assessed defect rates and lead times to determine the most reliable suppliers.  
- **Cost Optimization** → Examined shipping costs per unit to identify cost-saving opportunities.  
- **Demand vs. Supply Trends** → Compared stock levels against order quantities to optimize inventory planning.
